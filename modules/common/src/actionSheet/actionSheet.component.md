# IDEAActionSheetComponent

It's an alternative for desktop devices to the traditional ActionSheet.
It shares (almost) the same inputs so they are interchangeable.

## Selector

idea-action-sheet

## Inputs

- `buttons` (*ActionSheetButton<any>[]*) - An array of buttons for the actions panel.
- `cssClass` (*string*) - Additional classes to apply for custom CSS. If multiple classes are provided they should be separated by spaces.
- `header` (*string*) - Title for the actions panel.
- `subHeader` (*string*) - Subtitle for the actions panel.
